      "Content": "To compute the vector pointing to the \"front-right\" of an entity, you need to combine the forward vector with the right vector. Here's how you can do it:\n\n1. **Compute the forward vector**: This is already done in your `get_forward_vector` method.\n2. **Compute the right vector**: The right vector is perpendicular to the forward vector and points to the right of the entity. You can compute it using the entity's rotation.\n3. **Combine the two vectors**: Add the forward vector and the right vector, then normalize the result to get the \"front-right\" direction.\n\nHere’s an example implementation:\n\n```python\ndef get_right_vector(self) -> Vec3:\n    \"\"\"\n        Computes the right direction vector in world space.\n    \"\"\"\n    right_x = math.sin(self.rotation.y)\n    right_y = -math.cos(self.rotation.y)\n    right_z = 0  # Assuming no roll (rotation around the forward axis)\n\n    return Vec3(right_x, right_y, right_z).normalize()\n\ndef get_forward_right_vector(self) -> Vec3:\n    \"\"\"\n        Computes the forward-right direction vector in world space.\n    \"\"\"\n    forward = self.get_forward_vector()\n    right = self.get_right_vector()\n\n    # Combine forward and right vectors\n    forward_right = Vec3(\n        forward.x + right.x,\n        forward.y + right.y,\n        forward.z + right.z\n    )\n\n    return forward_right.normalize()\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Right Vector**:\n   - The right vector is derived from the entity's rotation around the Y-axis (yaw). It assumes no roll (rotation around the forward axis), so the Z-component is `0`.\n\n2. **Forward-Right Vector**:\n   - Adding the forward vector and the right vector gives a vector pointing diagonally to the \"front-right\".\n   - Normalizing the result ensures the vector has a unit length.\n\n### Usage:\nCall `get_forward_right_vector()` to get the direction pointing to the \"front-right\" of the entity in world space.",
