<!--  (does not apply to pyglet)
Due to the openGL library being the way it is, only x11 is supported, alternatively you can install [gamescope](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope) and run the client with `gamescope -- python launch.py`.
Gamescope should be readily available for debian, fedora, and arch based systems. However Ubuntu seems to somehow mess it up.
